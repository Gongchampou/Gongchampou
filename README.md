## 🔹 About Me  
- Passionate about blending chemistry and technology, I’m an MSc Chemistry graduate exploring the intersection of scientific research and software development. My work ranges from projects on oxide thin film catalysts (TiO₂, ZnO, etc.) to developing web and mobile applications with clean, efficient design and functionality.

- Currently focused on building full-stack educational platforms, web apps, and tools for research automation. I’m continuously learning modern frameworks and deployment workflows to turn ideas into scalable digital solutions.
- I believe that scientific thinking and coding creativity together can create meaningful solutions.
